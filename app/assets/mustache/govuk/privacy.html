  <p class="summary">After you send your application, it goes through several checks to make sure you’re entitled to register.</p>
  <p>
    1. This online service is run by the Cabinet Office. We may share your name, date of birth and National Insurance
    number with other government departments so they can check your details against their records and make sure they
    are genuine. We run the service in line with the law, including the Data Protection Act 1998. This means, for example,
    that your information won’t be shared with anyone else - unless sharing is allowed or required by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Your application is forwarded to your local Electoral Registration Office so they can check that you’re entitled
    to register. If they have any questions about your application, they will contact you. They may also check your
    immigration status with the Home Office.
  </p>

  <p>
    3. If the checks show you’re entitled to register, the Electoral Registration Office will add your name and address
      to the electoral register as part of the next monthly update. They will also include details of which elections
      you’re entitled to vote in, and when you turn 18 (if you’re under 18 when you register). You can opt out of
      including your name and address on the ‘open register’ - the version that’s available for sale to anyone.
  </p>

  <h2>How your local Electoral Registration Office will handle your information</h2>
